SenseBudget  – Personal budget management WebApp. 

1.  We aim to provide everyone a simple site
which is main function is to control and oversee monthly expenses. Those expenses can be added to
our website by categories, for example online services like Spotify, Netflix etc. or rent, gas, electricity
and water bills, mobile bills, or just any kind of expense.


2.  You can put a date on every expense, and you can see when you need to pay it. Our WebApp has an
integrated calendar or you can import the dates into your Google/Outlook/Apple calendars. Also you
are able to see the monthly total of the current month, previous month or add to the next months.
Surely you can also see the history of every month’s expenses. For privacy every bill can be edited or
deleted.


3.   The WebApp is simple and fast to use in every moment. We aim to also provide a mobile application
so you can add bills offline and as soon as the device goes online everything is synchronized with
your account.
